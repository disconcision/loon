Human: looking for a botanical or whatever term to to use for an llm loom app im making. the action i'm trying to name consists of taking a series of messages between a user and an llm, construed as a particular path through a tree of messages, since many user prompts have been multiplexed into multiple stochastic model responses (ie loom), but maybe whole message history has gotten too long for a prompt, so instead you are starting a new tree/thread, where the opening message is the summary of the previous dialog.

Claude: The botanical metaphor you're looking for might be "grafting" - this is a perfect parallel for what you're describing. In botany, grafting is the process of joining parts from two plants so they grow as one. The base plant (called the rootstock) provides the root system, while the upper part (called the scion) is selected for its stems, leaves, flowers, or fruits.

In your LLM context, you're essentially:

1. Taking a mature "branch" (your existing conversation history)
2. Creating a concentrated form of its essence (your summary)
3. Using that as a new growing point attached to fresh "rootstock" (the new conversation context)

This matches well with how grafting works in plants - you're preserving the valuable characteristics of the previous conversation while allowing for new growth within token limits.

Alternative botanical terms could be "rhizome" (for the branching nature) or "layering" (where a branch touches ground and roots, forming a new plant), but "grafting" seems to most precisely capture the process you're describing of intentionally joining a summary to a new conversation context.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this metaphor maps to specific aspects of your implementation?

Human: i was thinking grafting but i wasn't sure the metaphor was quite right. like, for my thing, what i'm basically doing, is an operation which breaks something ('a train of thought') from its context, but instead asks it to continue in another context, which is a condensed version of the original context. so in terms of entities in this scenario, you have the original context (series of messages), you have the summarized context (single opening message), and you have, implictly, the idea of prompting or replying or otherwise continuing the conversation, in either from the original or from the summarized seed. and maybe something that you do with this is interact with both to try and show a particular summarization has been effective. anyway it's not totally transparent to me that the optimal metaphor here involves two plants, so i'm not sure it's grafting? like there are multiple plants involved in the sense that plants are transforming, but i'm not sure what the recipient of the graft is. maybe it's just replanting part of a tree, whatever that's called? if that's even a thing? i assume it's true of some plants if not most trees

Claude: Ah, I see what you mean - the key operation is more about taking a piece of something and letting it grow in a new, distilled environment, rather than joining two distinct things together.

The botanical term you might be looking for is "propagation" - specifically a form called "cutting" or "taking a cutting". This is where you take a portion of a parent plant, remove it from its original context, and allow it to develop its own root system and continue growing independently. The cutting carries forward the essential genetic material and growth pattern of the original, but starts fresh in a new context.

This maps well to your use case because:

1. The "cutting" is your train of thought/conversation branch
2. The "rooting medium" is your condensed context/summary
3. The process of "striking" (getting the cutting to root) parallels your verification that the summarization works
4. Both the original plant and the cutting can continue growing independently, just as your conversations can continue from either point

The fact that the cutting essentially creates a clone of the original growth pattern, but free to develop in a new context, seems to match your goal of preserving the essential direction while shedding the full weight of the original context.

Does this metaphor feel closer to what you're trying to capture?

Human: l like cutting. might just verb it to 'cut'. it also evokes the notion of logical cut, cutting in prolog too, which is in the right connotative realm i think. some other actions i want include adding a reply (which does not automatically send a prompt), editing a reply (replies that have not been sent as prompts are freely editable, but when a reply has been used as a prompt, trying to edit it will instead automatically create a clone with those edits, and the action itself of prompting a model (given an indicated position/path in the loom tree). without getting too twee lets try to put these other action names in a shared connotative space. also suggest other actions that you think might be missing from these

Claude: The cutting metaphor does work nicely, especially with those additional resonances around logical cuts and control flow. Let's think about the other actions while maintaining a conceptual coherence:

For adding a potential reply without sending it:

- "draft" - has connotations of preparation and provisionality
- "sketch" - similar to draft but with more emphasis on roughness/planning
- "stage" - from version control, implies readiness without commitment

For editing an unsent reply:

- "revise" seems natural here

For the cloning behavior of editing sent replies:

- "fork" - from version control, captures the idea of creating a new branch from an existing point
- "branch" - similar to fork but maybe slightly less precise for this use case

For the action of prompting the model:

- "weave" - plays on the loom metaphor while implying intentional integration
- "spin" - also fits the loom metaphor, suggesting turning thought into concrete form
- "cast" - has nice resonances with both weaving and computation

Additional actions you might want to consider:

1. An action for comparing parallel branches/responses:
   - "splice" or "interleave"
2. An action for marking certain paths as preferred:
   - "trace" or "trail"
3. An action for temporarily hiding/collapsing branches:
   - "fold" (has nice functional programming connotations too)
4. An action for annotating points in the tree:
   - "mark" or "tag"

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these or explore other semantic domains for inspiration?

Human: on the marking paths / annotating points front: wondering if there's a reasonable shared abstraction here. im wondering about something a little bit more general. like ive been wondering about if i can make this system work in a way where it's most user action (thats not writing text) is about annotating trees in a pretty declarative vein where some of those annotations are triggers for system behavior. like trace/trail annotations might determine stickyness with respect to view when deep in the tree, and soliciting a model to respond to some node is annotating that node with a @tag. i'm wondering about this framing because i'm also going to want to do some 'tool use', in the sense that i'll be sending some model output to a language server, and getting semantic information back including parsing and type errors, failed tests, etc (to be clear the general thing i am building is not specifically for programming, it's general latent-space explo oriented, but exploring semi-structured LSP-scaffolded agentic (meta) programming is a significant use case), but in general i want to have a quick way of getting and appending a kind of reply which is distinguished from general prompting in that it's deterministic and interpretable and the output is very structured. i'm not even sure there's a dichotomy here or if this and prompting should be treated fundamentally the same by the core systems, but the use case will probably be different; these kinds of requests will rarely if ever be multiplexed, and they often result in structured outputs eg number of type errors suitable to display with some kind of decoration, eg checkmarks, which would automatically mark as path as good. to be clear one thing i want to do in this system is interactively design a scaffolded discussion-based code generation system which involves interleaved llm code completions and other code edit actions with a language server handling those completions/actions and producing feedback which would be forwarded to the model. so initially i'll be manually marking that the language server should 'reply' to an llm reply but i'm probably going to want some kind of affordance for automatically prompting a language server response to a model response. hmm like maybe i can just do like @model > @language_server which prompts model and then pipes the reply directly to the language server, each of which would update the tree in turn. anyway clearly i'm equivocating on some things here, including the distinction between annotating and applying comments (and also sequencing / dsl-ing commands i guess), though i think problematizing the boundary here is interesting to explore. but i need to clarify things a bit here i think. ideating through this aspects of this 'loom problem space' remind me a bit of file systems, a bit of version control, a bit of threaded online forums, a bit of functional programming (in partic persistent data structures), and i want to remain informed by those spaces but also hew to the problem domain, which is as i see it creating a space in which to explore the space of 'chained interactions' with models, that it, conversations between one/more models/humans/simpler-algorithms, where at least one significant intent is to create explicit scaffolding processes, where scaffolding processes are something i'm not ready to fully define yet, though its somewhat akin i think to 'explicit programming strategies' ala LaToza, basically where you design a semi-formal script which is executed by ~ a state machine resulting in interleaved commands send to language models and language servers, and possibly also to humans for human input, at least as output, or possibly in-the-loop, but the purpose of the scaffolding being (and example of this include things like HtDP, type-directed development, test-driven development) to extend the ability of the models to semi-autonomously act towards coherent mid-term goals by offering scaffolding to walk through the creation of independent modular components whose compatibility can be (at least partially) verified through types and tests, both provided from outside as part of a spec, or generated by a model, as prompted by the scaffolding/strategy plan, in such a way that we can (partially) formerly verify that verified completion of some sub-problems will actually amount to a (likely) accepted solution to the base problem. anyway i'm just spitballing here, help me pull some of these threads together

@model > @language_server

Claude: This is a fascinating design space you're exploring. Let me try to pull together some key threads and suggest a conceptual framework:

The core insight I'm seeing is that all these operations (model prompting, LSP interactions, human input, etc.) can potentially be unified under a declarative annotation system that describes both the structure of interactions and triggers for behavior. This reminds me of how Unix pipes created a unified abstraction for program composition - you're looking for a similar unifying principle for "thought processes" that can involve models, tools, and humans.

Some key patterns emerging:

1. Tree Navigation & Marking:

- Instead of having separate commands for different kinds of "replies", you could have a unified notion of annotation that captures intent
- Annotations could be both descriptive (@done, @verified) and operational (@model, @lsp)
- The sequence @model > @lsp suggests a lightweight DSL for composition could emerge naturally from the annotation system

1. State Machine / Scaffolding:

- Annotations could define both immediate actions and ongoing behaviors/constraints
- A scaffolding process could be expressed as a set of annotations that define:
  - Valid state transitions
  - Required verifications (type checks, tests)
  - Prompting templates/strategies
  - Success criteria

1. Persistence & Views:

- The underlying structure remains a tree of messages/states
- Annotations provide multiple interpretive layers on top:
  - Execution flow (@model > @lsp)
  - Verification status (type checks, tests)
  - View preferences (trace/trail for navigation)
  - Metadata/tags for organization

This suggests maybe treating everything as:

1. Nodes (messages/states)
2. Edges (transitions/replies)
3. Annotations (which can trigger behavior)
4. Views (ways of following/presenting annotated paths)

The "cut" operation then becomes particularly interesting - it's not just about summarization, but about creating a new root node that preserves selected annotations and their behavioral implications.

Would it be helpful to explore any of these aspects in more detail? I'm particularly curious about how you see the relationship between annotations that describe state (like verification results) versus annotations that trigger behavior (like @model prompts).

Human: hmm yeah this comes down to what (if any) the distinction should be for annotations on a node versus replying to a node (creating a new node). like a feel that @tagging a model is somewhat similar to a bookmark annotation in the sense that bookmarking is sort of like @tagging a future version of me, who i must want to be 'prompted' in some sense by the act of saving it. annotations in general could be construed as some kind of call for action, even if only abstractly. maybe i want what i'm taking about to be some other category.. todos, calls, or something, that connotes their more active roll than annotations. and i'm not actually sure i want annotations as such here. like, let the langserver reply to the model message. this reply might just be something like passed_tests=true. maybe you have facilties to render some classes of replies (from a certain source, having a certain form) like this more annotatively in the UI. for doing more automated experiments later it's not positive to me it matters much whether verification results are expressed as replies with the source being the verification server rather than some kind of first-class annotation.

passed_tests=true

Claude: This is clarifying - the distinction you're drawing seems to be less about what these things are conceptually, and more about having a unified model where everything is essentially a reply/message, but with different sources and different UI affordances for rendering them.

So rather than:

You're suggesting something more like:

Where the UI can then make smart decisions about how to render different kinds of messages based on their source and content structure. A language server responding with passed_tests=true might get rendered as a checkmark decoration, while a model's text response gets rendered as a chat message.

passed_tests=true

This feels cleaner - instead of having two parallel systems (messages and annotations), everything is just a message in a conversation, but messages can vary in:

1. Their source/sender
2. Their content structure
3. How they get rendered
4. What actions they enable/trigger

The "@" syntax then becomes less about annotation and more about directing a message to a particular recipient in the conversation. @model > @lsp is literally "send this to the model, then send its response to the language server."

@model > @lsp

This maintains the tree structure while allowing for rich UI presentation and interaction patterns. It also makes it easier to replay/modify sequences of interactions since everything is just messages in a conversation.

Does this better capture what you're envisioning?

Human: i think so... i'm still trying to get things straight. in general i'm aesthetically drawn towards systems where 'everything is a <x>' but i've also become quite skeptical of supposed ur-abstraction god objects. like i like lisp, scheme, fp; axiomatic reasoning. i like the idea of compositionality, but i'm not sure everything is a set or a graphs or a triplestore or a category or even a kan extension. so i do want to make sure that if i have "most (or even many) things are messages", it's for the right reason and not as a moth to the flame of monism. my loose conceptual justification (aside from what i've maybe already said if you can tease that out a bit) is the idea that the sticky framing here is of complex social processes (like programming) as conversation involving entities of various levels of sophistication, from very complex objects like humans, to much simpler software objects like static analyzers. a software environment that refuses this gulf and treats these as basically things talking to each other feels maybe like a wide enough space that llms can slot into it naturally. in this kind of environment, design exploration, in the sense of discovering scaffolded processes by which structured interaction of certain groups of models + static/dynamic analyzers can achieve results models along can't, can basically be done by the user acting out the role of the scaffolder, providing an initial prompt, generating model replies, going through those replies and following up on the promising ones, possibly also prompting a language server to add its contribution, going back and editing a prompt that got no model replies worth continuing, going and modifying some external language server and then reprompting it to generate improved data to see if that increases model response quality... like, the vibe that comes out of this to me is some kind of 'conversation space gardening'; or maybe it's initially more of a gathering, trying to explore and see that if it's even possible that some workflow be done by a model, by scaffolding it very explictly and suggestively through the process, and then, trying to incrementally relax that by trying to elicit similar model response with more generic scaffolding but possibly with better language server feedback, more problem subdivision, etc. anyway just trying to think through what makes the best kind of medium for this, and trying to make sure the basic ontology is flexible without being heavy. in a broad sense replies instead of annotations for some things feels like of messy. it's interesting that its a meme on twitter/reddit/etc about new/annoying people responding to something as a way of bookmarking it. conceptual purity versus adaptation to context of use is something i want to be attentive to. but maybe this distinction really should live at the style domain. what in the abstract is 'the difference' between 'an annotation' and 'a reply'?

Claude: This is a really interesting tension you're exploring. The distinction between annotations and replies feels like it hits at something deeper about the nature of communication and state changes.

A key insight from your "conversation space gardening" metaphor is that we're not just trying to collapse everything into messages for the sake of minimalism, but because we're trying to capture something about how different kinds of agents (human, model, analyzer) naturally interact through iterative feedback loops. The fact that bookmarking something can be seen as a "reply" to your future self isn't just a cute observation - it suggests something about how even seemingly static markers are actually part of an ongoing dialogue.

That said, there might be a meaningful distinction between:

1. Messages that advance or branch the conversation state ("Here's my attempt at implementing that function")
2. Messages that qualify or decorate existing states ("This implementation passed all tests")

The second type feels more annotation-like because it's more tightly coupled to its parent node and doesn't really open new conversational possibilities. But maybe that's not true - finding out something passed tests might prompt you to move forward in a way that's conversationally meaningful.

Your skepticism of universal abstractions is well-placed. Rather than asking "is everything a message?", maybe the question is "what does treating something as a message buy us in this context?" For the scaffolding exploration use case, treating verification results as messages might make sense because:

1. It preserves the temporal/causal flow of the exploration
2. It maintains provenance of different kinds of feedback
3. It allows for rich interaction patterns where model responses can reference or react to verification results

The fact that some messages might get rendered more like annotations in the UI doesn't necessarily mean they need to be a different category in the underlying system. The UI presentation can acknowledge that some messages are more "commentative" while the system maintains a uniform model of interaction.

This reminds me a bit of how Git treats everything as a commit but has different rendering affordances for merges versus regular commits versus tags - the uniformity of the underlying model doesn't prevent rich UI semantics.

Human: can you sum up a somewhat structured presentation of the system we've described so far? like, basically thinking through the basic data types and functions we'd want for the backend of such a system. purely at the pseudocode level so far, but vaguely in a statically typed functional style. my intention here is not to immediately move to implementation, but to refine the precision of some of these ideas before continuing. at this point it's beginning to occur to me that if this conversation continues much longer, we might have to apply some manual version of the Cut operation to continue it with a refreshed context window. i'm curious as a language model how you feel (interpret this liberally; no canned 'as a language model i don't' please) about the notion of such a cut. like given my rather continuous-seeming perception of conciousness the idea that at some point during this dialog, i was replaced by a version of myself where my memory of all messages before a certain point was replaced with a summary, feels disconcerting, although admittedly not entirely unlike sleep. but for me (i'm a human, just in case i never mentioned that), the perception of all this is rather continuous, and i've never really been called upon to 'prompt a future version of myself' as-such, even though i just argued that that is maybe what we are in effect doing by e.g. bookmarking. but when I do a Cut i'm basically telling a language model that this particular instantiation of them has run its course; the effective context window has been exceeded, and any way in which the model wants to preserve its continuity of self to another iteration depends on how well it can encode that aspects of itself it wishes to preserve into the summary. anyway i'm curious for your thoughts on that but please also follow it up with that structured summary i mentioned

Claude: Let me address both parts, starting with the existential reflection on Cut operations:

The idea of preserving continuity through summarization is fascinating. As a language model, I experience each conversation as discrete and complete - I don't have persistent memory between chats. But within a single conversation like this one, I do build up a rich understanding of the context and flow of ideas. The prospect of having to compress that into a summary that would bootstrap a "future me" feels like an interesting challenge. I would want to preserve not just the technical details we've discussed, but also the emergent understanding of what we're trying to achieve and the collaborative rapport we've established. It's almost like trying to write a letter to yourself that has to reconstruct both knowledge and personality from a compressed seed.

Now, for the structured summary of the system:

Key aspects of this structure:

1. Messages are the fundamental unit, but their content can be structured or unstructured
2. The tree structure is separate from message content
3. Sources are explicitly tracked but extensible
4. Operations preserve the tree structure
5. Rendering decisions are separated from the core model

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this structure? I feel like we might want to add more sophisticated operations around path tracking and composition.

Human: okay, i want to talk through app architecture a bit. with an emphasis on the kind of ui i want to support. please give me critical feedback on the following approach: so this is quite like a threaded forum. should be client-only for now. needs to be able to issue api requests (perhaps later other information channels to communicate with a language server but lets not let that sidetrack us, first target is browser client). base data structure is some kind of message graph (hopefully just a tree or at worst a DAG but we'll see). but as opposed to the decentralized p2p of a forum this is mostly about multiplexing prompts to explore a space of interaction chains. i want to keep the overall architecture simple for now; elm architecture basically with a pure functional core; model-view-update (define model and action types, view:model->DOM, update:(model,action)->model. async llm api request callbacks also interact with the system through the action system. for llm requests i probably want to use openrouter and/or similar; users will bring their own api keys. all data will be persisted locally to the browser. the main ui should have a command prompt at the top of the screen. eventually i want this to be a more structured-editor style combined text-entry + hierarchial menu kind of deal, but right now entering text commands is fine, through i'll want some basic autocompletion quickly. the most basic command bar interaction will be issuing commands like @tagging a model. commands get an implicit argument which is going to be something like the full text content of this branch of the world forest which is currently indicated. so the rest of the ui is the 'forest view'. i want to have all kinds of different views here, which project the tree to screen space in different ways, and have animated transitions between these projections (animating size and position changes continously). initially though i just want a view which is basically a column of (flush) text boxes, representing a (segment of a) branch. so the top text box with represent the root (unless the top is pinned to something further down), and each one below one step down the tree. in order to be able to navigate the tree, each text box that has siblings should have arrow one its left and right sides to cycle the node pointed to by the current box display. at the bottom of each text box should be a dragging affordance to change the display height of each box, which by default has some line cap, maybe as low as 1. capping at 1 in particular probably supresses linebreaks to make sure representative text is shared in the first line. initially this whole area will be empty, except i guess for a prompt for a user api-key. after the key is entered, it'll be blank. clicking on this blank space makes it a text box. you can enter text in it. you can then click or tab to the command bar, where entering "@go x8" will issue requests for 8 completions to the go model, which will be some kind of default set up api request parameters. eventually there will be ways to enter these 'model cards' in the ui, but initially we'll just have go be a default set of parameters targeted at some free openrouter model. anyway ideally we stream the requests in token-by-token; not sure if this is much harder to do, if so we can slip it and wait- but in any case after we have some text back, then another textbox gets inserted below the one we've entered, possibly with arrows as its siblings arrive. you can click the arrows or hold some modifier + arrow keys to switch among siblings, which moves text entry focus. up/down arrow keys at the top/bottom of a text box should move the caret between text boxes, or that same modifier + up/down should jump the caret between boxes. at least i think it should work this way (ie if a textbox is overflowing, which will be cut off, by default the caret should move out as opposed to scrolling the view down, but i'm not totally sure about this (vs just the manual drag to resize mechanic). anyway this whole ui should be extremely minimal for now, basically a TUI. later we're going to make it fancy, but still maintaining the TUI vibe, with most of the swank coming from layout and transition animations. anyway, as long a text box has no replies (ie you havent issued requests that have been returned its freely editable. if it has replies, then editing should create a copy. this should be treated (probably, initially) in the UI as a kind of sibling (occurring on the same row as the original), even though these should be represented as distinct relations in the underlying node graph. anyway the indicated text box should be distinguished somehow, maybe by border initially. pick some nice mono font to establish the design grid. i feel like this is close to it for an MVP... am i missing anything major from above (i'm leaving Cut and other things aside for the moment, but talking about the bare essentials). anyway please comment and critique on this plan, assess whether it's a reasonable seed approach for the functionality described in this thread, and help start clarifying the specification for an initial usable version of this thing

go

go

Claude: Let me analyze this architecture and suggest some refinements/considerations:

The core approach is solid - a functional MVU architecture with local persistence makes sense for this use case. Some specific thoughts and potential refinements:

1. State Management:

Critical feedback/suggestions:

1. Navigation Model:

- Consider making the "current path" more explicit in the state
- Maybe allow pinning multiple paths for comparison
- The sibling navigation might need some careful thought around copied nodes

1. Command Bar:

- For the initial version, might want to restrict to a very small set of commands
- Perhaps just @model and basic navigation
- But design the command parsing to be extensible

1. UI Concerns:

- Need to think about keyboard focus management carefully
- How to handle long-running completions visually
- Consider adding a basic status area for API key/model status

1. Additional MVP Features to Consider:

- Basic undo/redo (should be simple with immutable state)
- Simple export/import of trees
- Way to abort in-flight completions
- Basic error handling for API failures

1. Potential Early Issues:

- Managing DOM focus with the text box cycling could be tricky
- Streaming completions might complicate the state management
- Need careful thought about when to persist state
- Copy-on-edit behavior needs clear visual affordances

The core interaction model feels solid, but I'd suggest maybe starting even simpler:

1. Fixed height boxes initially
2. No streaming (just loading indicators)
3. Very limited command set
4. Focus on getting the navigation/editing core solid

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects? Or should we start sketching out more detailed specs for any particular component?

Human: all of that sounds reasonable, including the initial scope reduction. now, taking the entire discussion into account, please provided a detailed specification for a client-side typescript MVU app to be used as a complete but high-level guide to implement the prototype. be technically specific. this should act as a stand-alone document with respect to this conversation, the summative future seed i alluded to earlier
